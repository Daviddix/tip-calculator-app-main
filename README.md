## Overview
This is a simple web app that calculates tips based on the users inputs; Bill, Tip percent and Number of people.
The web app was made with simple web dev languages; HTML, CSS and vanilla javaScript.
The design and assets were gotten from a challenge given by frontendmentor

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
